I have started thinking of blank lines as "separating/grouping concepts when needed".

So if I have three concepts on three lines, I might put all three lines together, to save space.

But if one of those concepts now suddenly needs two lines, I will put some blank lines around it, to separate it from the other concepts/tasks.  Then I might also separate the other two lines, to show that there are three separate concepts (one of which uses two lines).

Also, I will keep a line or two immediately next to an if block or for loop, if that line is part of the same task.
