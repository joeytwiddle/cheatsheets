Late 2024:

Tried installing Home to Command Left and End to Command Right.

The problem is when these are used in a browser but NOT focused on an edit box, Command Left/Right actually navigate back/fowards in the history which is very confusing.

So I tried mapp Home to Ctrl A and End to Ctrl E which solved that problem.  But then Home and End wouldn't scroll to top/bottom of page like they used to.

We might be able to resolve this if we can determine that the focus is on some kind of text editing element.
