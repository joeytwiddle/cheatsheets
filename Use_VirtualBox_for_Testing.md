## Abstract

This is a guide for developers on macOS or Linux who need to test a Windows app they have built.

## Prerequisites

Install vagrant and VirtualBox

## Get started

```
mkdir vagrant_win2012
cd vagrant_win2012

# Download the image
# You may of course choose to install a different Windows image from here:
# https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search
# This one needs 5GB disk space
vagrant init opentable/win-2012r2-standard-amd64-nocm

# Start it running
# Needs 10GB disk space
vagrant up
```

This starts the machine running but in the background (headless).

Open VirtualBox.  You should be able to click to `Show` the running machine.

## Save a snapshot

Before messing up this machine, let's first save a nice clean snapshot.

1. Click through any initial setup wizards, to get the machine into a nice state

2. Click `Machine > Take Snapshot`

## Close the machine

Do anything you want on the machine, make a mess.  Then do the following, which will forget your changes:

1. Select `File > Close` (or hit the window's close button)

2. Select `Power off the machine` and also `Restore current snapshot`

Why?

- We don't want the remember/store the _current_ messy state of the machine, because we are going to use the clean snapshot in future.  (This allows us to test repeatedly, starting with a clean install each time.)

- The next time we start the machine, we don't want to wait while it boots up.  It will start immediately in the snapshot state, which is faster than a full boot.

- Starting from an early snapshot also means our virtual machine won't slowly grow in size over time.

(You can manage snapshots from the â‰¡ menu by each machine in the main VirtualBox Manager window.)

## Use the machine for testing

You can use this process to build `.exe` files on your host machine, and test them in the virtual machine.

1. Open the virtual machine.  Open the File Manager and navigate to `Network > \\VBOXSVR\Vagrant`

   This folder corresponds to `vagrant_win2012/` on your host machine (the first folder you created).

   (I like to make a shortcut to this folder, and save that in a Snapshot.)

2. On your host machine, drop a file into `vagrant_win2012/`

3. On the virtual machine, press `F5` to refresh the File Manager.  You should see your file appear.

4. Run your file inside the virtual machine.

## Folders and space

Vagrant will download the initial image to:

```bash
du -sh ~/.vagrant.d/
```

VirtualBox will store the disk image and snapshots in:

```bash
du -sh ~/VirtualBox VMs/
```

If you don't plan to use vagrant again after the initial download, you could remove the folder `~/.vagrant.d/boxes` or the entire thing.
